    <H2>Brendan Willis</H2>
    <H2>In Elementry they called me Bwill</H2>
    <P>I have come from the far away land of Utah, to furhter my major in Computer Science.
    I have done my fair share of hard labor, and if that has taught me anything it's that 
    they sure break your body down. Not that I did not have fun welding, sanding wooden furniture 
    or making bullet proof windows, and not to mention the pay was good, all that mattered in the end was the question
    "will I wake up with more back pain tomorow?"
    This is what helped me take theis next step in my life.</P>
    <p>My hobbies include; being with people I care about, watching movies, playing video games, reading books and enjoying a 
    good meme with my friends.</p>   
    <p>One of the things I like moste about Rexburg and geing in BYU-Idaho is how simular it is to my home in Utah.
    The wind is strog and cold, and the snow even colder, although I do notice the humidity up here allows the snow
    to hang around for longer, and in my humble opinion that aint right! But I suppose I can always learn new and
    fun things to do with this snow that likes to hang around. If you have gotten this far in my profile you deserve a cookie,
    get yourself one.</P>
